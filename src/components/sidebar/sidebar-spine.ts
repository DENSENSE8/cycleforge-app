 * Sidebar spine geometry — the ONE place the column width lives.
 *
 * It used to be a bare `w-[360px]` literal written out in several files (the
 * docked sidebar, its dynamic-import placeholder, the error fallback), each
 * carrying a comment asking the others to stay in step. The spine mounts in two
 * different hosts — the desktop push column and the mobile drawer — so a
 * drifting literal would show up as the panel changing size between them.
 *
 * **This is the NAV spine only.** The route's context panel
 * (`CONTEXT_PANEL_WIDTH_PX` / `CONTEXT_PANEL_COLUMN_CLASS`) defaults to 360px
 * and deliberately does not consume this: they are two measurements for two
 * jobs. Receiving can drag-resize its rail via `CONTEXT_PANEL_RESIZE`; wiring
 * the panel to this spine token would still mean narrowing the nav silently
 * narrows every route's default rail.
 *
 * **Desktop is drag-resizable now (2026-08-16); this class is the MOBILE
 * drawer's fixed width only.** `SidebarNavColumn`'s desktop push column reads
 * its live width from `useHorizontalEdgeResize` ({@link SIDEBAR_SPINE_RESIZE}
 * below), because a Tailwind class cannot be interpolated per-drag-frame. The
 * mobile drawer has no mouse to drag with, so it keeps this static class
 * unchanged — `SIDEBAR_SPINE_WIDTH_PX` is that drawer's fixed width AND the
 * desktop resize's persisted default.
