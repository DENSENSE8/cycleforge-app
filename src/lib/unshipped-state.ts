/**
 * Unshipped (pre‑dock) package state — shared derivation helpers for the full
 * sold → label → test → pack → dock pipeline.
 *
 * **Surface ownership (2026-06):**
 * - `AWAITING_LABEL` → Outbound · Labels (`/outbound`)
 * - `PENDING` / `TESTED` / `BLOCKED` → Dashboard · Unshipped (`deriveFulfillmentState`)
 * - `PACKED_STAGED` → Outbound · Scan-out; seam color shared with `outbound-state.ts`
 * - Post-dock states → `outbound-state.ts` on Dashboard · Shipped
 *
 * This is the inbound mirror of {@link OUTBOUND_STATE_META} in `outbound-state.ts`.
 * The two models meet at ONE shared seam state, `PACKED_STAGED`: it is the
 * terminal unshipped state AND the initial outbound state, so the dock scan‑out
 * is exactly the `PACKED_STAGED → SCANNED_OUT` transition that hands a package
 * from this model to the outbound one. To guarantee the seam never drifts, the
 * `PACKED_STAGED` dot/pill colors here are re‑used from the outbound meta.
 *
 * Color rule: no two status dots across BOTH models share a hue. The unshipped
 * states claim slate / yellow / teal / red; `PACKED_STAGED` is the shared amber;
 * the outbound states own blue / indigo / emerald / rose / orange / pink.
 *
 * Pure + isomorphic (no React, no DOM, no Date.now): safe on client and server.
 * "Late" is a deadline overlay, not a pipeline stage — see {@link isUnshippedLate}.
